	---help---
	  Binder is used in Android for both communication between processes,
	  and remote method invocation.

	  This means one Android process can call a method/routine in another
	  Android process, using Binder to identify, invoke and pass arguments
	  between said processes.

config ANDROID_BINDER_DEVICES
	string "Android Binder devices"
	depends on ANDROID_BINDER_IPC
	default "binder,hwbinder,vndbinder"
	---help---
	  Default value for the binder.devices parameter.

	  The binder.devices parameter is a comma-separated list of strings
	  that specifies the names of the binder device nodes that will be
	  created. Each binder device has its own context manager, and is
	  therefore logically separated from the other devices.

config ANDROID_FSTAB_FAKE
	bool "Enable android fstab driver for fake DT fstab"
	depends on PROC_FS
	---help---
	  This is intended to allow early mounting partitions
	  on devices without DT, or where DT can't be modified.
